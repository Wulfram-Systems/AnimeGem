# AnimeGem: Anime Store Shopify Website 

AnimeGem is a Shopify powered ecommerce site selling various anime products. With this project, I familiarized myself with Shopify's "Liquid" syntax and learned how create customizable features within an exisiting theme.

The website is based off of the "Debut" theme, with various customizable features/additions listed below.

In addition, I learned how to utilize ThemeKit to work on code within my chosen IDE as opposed to Shopify's browser version. This created a more efficient coding experience.

## Customizations Made
- "Social Media" Dynamic Block in footer, allows for dynamic movement of block within the footer (was originally static and next to the copyright line)
- Custom Action Buttons section for homepage, can be added and moved dynamicically with other homepage blocks
- Shipping Message option in Cart 
- Custom “View All” Buttons to include what collection will display (UI improvement)

## Custom Files Developed
- sections > action-buttons.liquid
- section > cart-text.liquid

## Files Edited for Custom Changes
- sections > collection.liquid
- sections > footer.liquid
- assets > theme.css
